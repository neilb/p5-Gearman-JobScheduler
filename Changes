Revision history for Perl module Gearman::JobScheduler

0.09   2013-10-28
    * Make "unique_job_id()" public for the use of client applications because
      they might want to generate their own unique job IDs in order to test
      whether or not a job with given parameters is enqueued.

0.08   2013-10-21
    * Gearman::JobScheduler::Admin utility package for administering the
      server (just like "gearadmin" does).
    * Removed Gearman::JobScheduler::cancel_gearman_job() subroutine as
      redundant.
    * Don't die() when a log path is not found.
    * Added Gearman/JobScheduler/Worker.pm to the list of "provided" files.

0.07   2013-10-07
    * Moose 2.1005 requirement.

0.06   2013-10-07
    * Handle (log) undefined arguments to run() correctly.

0.05   2013-10-07
    * Use SHA256 hashes for GJS-generated unique job identifiers because the
      job identifier is limited to 64 bytes by Gearman which is usually not
      enough.

0.04   2013-09-30
    * Ability to start multiple worker instances of a single Gearman function.

0.03   2013-09-30
    * Gearman functions can now provide their own default configurations.

0.02   2013-09-30
    * Moved worker helper subroutines to a separate package so that they can be
      reused more easily.

0.01   2013-09-16
    * Initial release.
